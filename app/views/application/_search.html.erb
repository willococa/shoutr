<!-- this file has been created inside the application folder because when the rais engine looks for
a template it searches based in the conroller name like so: 
"DashboardsController" => views/dashboards folder, so then if we create a views/application folder
the engine will look the search template inside the dashboard folder *where it's being called
and if it doesn't find  it then it'll look in a hierarchichal controller. as the DashboardController extends ApplicationController, then creating an "aplication" folder will make it so it serves as a general partial folder for all controller views that inherit from applicationcontroller  -->

<!-- now having created a form with a :search simbol makes it so that if the instance variable "search" exists, it will prepopulate the form with any of the values that variable contains,
	in this case the @search variable contains a term value inside

 -->
<%= form_for :search, url: search_path, method: :get do |form| %>
	<%= form.text_field :term, placeholder: "Search here" %>
	<%= form.submit "Search" %>
<% end %>
